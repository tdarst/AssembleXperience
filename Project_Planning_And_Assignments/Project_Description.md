# **Project Abstract**
The goal of this project is to write an assembler and ISA level simulator for the LC-3 language that is understandable, easily to modify, and open-source so it can be a powerful learning tool in the hands of students. To make this project easy to understand, I've written it in Python due to its verbose syntax, ease of use with UI libraries like PyQt5 and powerful network of libraries.
