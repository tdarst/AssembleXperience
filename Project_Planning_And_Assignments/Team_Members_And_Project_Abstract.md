# Project Abstract
The goal of this project is to write an assembler, disassembler, and simulator for the LC-3 instruction set that is easy to understand, easily modifiable, and open-source so it can become a powerful learning tool in the hands of professors and students. In order to make this project easy to understand, I've chosen to write my program in a highly abstract language, Python. Easy modification is also achieved through the use of Python because of its ease of use with GUI libraries such as tKinter and its powerful network of built-in and third party libraries. Lastly the open-source aspect will be achieved through public availability of code.
