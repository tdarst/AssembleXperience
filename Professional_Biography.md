# **Professional Biography**
Throughout my years co-oping at the University of Cincinnati I've worked in two different facets of the tech industry for two different companies.
My first three rotations were spent with Honeywell Intelligrated working with controls software and devices for the purpose of creating
efficient conveyor systems. There I wrote code in Studio5000 as well as worked with physical devices to fix problems that would come up in the
warehouses I worked in. Upon leaving this position I received a full-time offer from my manager upon graduation but chose to pursue other facets
of the tech industry, namely traditional software. I learned quite a bit from my time working at Intelligrated including how to effectively work
with engineering teams both in person and remotely, how to write well-documented and efficient code, and how to communicate professionally with my
co-workers.

My final co-op semester I spent at NLign Analytics. Through my time over the Summer semester I completed, in python and batch, an internal tool for the
Director of Operations to use that fulfilled three seperate functions. The first of which was that it would combine timesheet data exported from 
Costpoint each day with historical data from previous timesheet softwares to create actual hours and financial values, and then use COM methods to
update the internal task tracking software, NTrack, with these values. The second function my project completed was that it would go through all of the task
data in NTrack and "rollup" all of the hours and financial data from children tasks to the parent tasks, effectively finding the costs and hours for all
of the hierarchical "parents" through examination of the "children." The final function of my project was to take task data from NTrack and to use COM
methods to update Microsoft Project Developer plans on hours, task status, financial costs, and other important information stored in NTrack. This
project proved to be a massive learning experience for me as it went through a lot of changes in value calculation methods, project requirements, and testing
procedures. My main takeaways from this project were learning how to effectively test software that has undergone a lot of changes, how to effectively
utilize breakpoints to bugfix efficiently in a project with a very large amount of handled data, and how to design larger projects from scratch so that
they can best accomodate change down the road. After this co-op semester I recieved a part-time offer to continue with the company during my class semesters.
